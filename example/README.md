This folder contains examples for using `go-allegro`. The import paths for these examples assume that the `go-allegro` source is contained inside some `src/github.com/dradtke/go-allegro` in your `GOPATH`. In addition to that, they must be run from the `example` folder in order for the image to load correctly.
